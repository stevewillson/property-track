# Property Tracker Generator

Property tracker generator takes a GCSS-A generated hand receipt and transforms it to a useful CSV file that can be used to easily track property. Based on a defined monthly inventory schedule, it can also generate a projected month for particular property to be viewed for a monthly cyclic inventory.

## Usage

Open the file `main.html` and select a hand receipt. The property tracker will output a CSV file with property split up in rows
