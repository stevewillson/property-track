# Property Tracker Generator

Property tracker generator takes a GCSS-A generated hand receipt and transforms it to a useful CSV file that can be used to easily track property. Based on a defined monthly inventory schedule, it can also generate a projected month for particular property to be viewed for a monthly cyclic inventory.



## Usage

```
git clone <PROJECT>

cd <PROJECT DIR>

python3 -m http.server 

```

Navigate to the server page (most likely http://localhost:8000/main.html), upload your hand receipt and then see the output as a CSV file property tracker.
